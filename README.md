# Quebert
A Discord bot built for the MetaIntro community: https://discord.gg/CcdNdq3YbT

## Summary
Quebert is currently hard at work in the Discord, in the meantime changes will be made to allow for community contributions in the form of bounties. In the meantime you can check out the library used to write Quebert here: ( https://discord.js.org/#/ ). You should also check out and follow their guide which is extremely detailed and helpful: ( https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin )

Back soon,
