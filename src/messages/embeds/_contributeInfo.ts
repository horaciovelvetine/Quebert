        A lot of our community members are making the jump from web2 to web3 and need some experience to put on their resume. So, after polling with the community, we decided to release some Metaintro-related bounties! 

        If you're looking for experience to put onto your resume, please check out the bounty board. All bounties will be paid in Kudos (at least for now), and those Kudos will eventually live in your Metaintro wallet! ðŸ’•

        ðŸš€ This bounty board will be updated weekly.

        Here's the link ðŸ‘‰ :
