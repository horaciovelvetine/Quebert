		`Our goal in this Discord is to get you hired. We decided that we are going to verify roles manually. Why? Because it'll help reduce the time to hire for both YOU and the employers that come into our ecosystem ðŸ’•

This is how it works:

1. DM me @LaceyK what role you'd like to have assigned to your Discord profile. Either pick as many roles as you'd like from the below list OR create your own! 

Make sure you have DM's turned on for the server! (Do that in your settings).

2. ðŸš€ Please provide PROOF that you are skilled in your field. Proof can look in some of the following ways:

ðŸ‘‰ A link to your portfolio
ðŸ‘‰ A link to your GitHub
ðŸ‘‰ A screenshot of your role in another community
ðŸ‘‰ Social media or press links
ðŸ‘‰ If you'd prefer to remain anon - that's ok! Screenshots of you being active elsewhere works.
ðŸ‘‰ Any other form of verification that you feel would help us verify that you are legitimate in your field.


ðŸ’¥ Warning ðŸ’¥
Please follow the above steps! You should only being sending me two things - 1) the role(s) you want and 2) a way to verify it. Do NOT send me anything else. It may take me up to 48 hrs to respond and assign a role.`
